Why do students stay in or leave STEM majors?

This was my portion of a project designed to determine the main factors influencing students' decisions to stay in or leave STEM majors. We used a dataset containing data from 57,635 students from Texas A & M from 2003 to 2016. I used logistic regression with stepwise and best-subsets selection to develop models to predict whether a student in a STEM major would graduate with a STEM degree. 

(The introduction is missing in my write-up because another student in my group wrote that part for our combined paper)
